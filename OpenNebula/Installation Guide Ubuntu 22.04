First Enable add and enable the Reponsitories
 # echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/opennebula.gpg] https://<token>@enterprise.opennebula.io/repo/6.10/Ubuntu/24.04 stable opennebula" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opennebula.list

Now install the required pacakges

# apt-get update
# apt-get -y install gnupg wget apt-transport-https


Now ensure that the the keys are downloaded
# sudo wget -q -O- https://downloads.opennebula.io/repo/repo2.key | gpg --dearmor --yes --output /etc/apt/keyrings/opennebula.gpg
Now Downlaod OpenNebula
 # echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/opennebula.gpg] https://downloads.opennebula.io/repo/6.10/Ubuntu/22.04 stable opennebula" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opennebula.list
 # apt-get update

Now Install OpenNebula
# apt-get update
# apt-get -y install opennebula opennebula-fireedge opennebula-gate opennebula-flow opennebula-provision

Start OpenNebula Services
# systemctl start opennebula opennebula-fireedge opennebula-gate opennebula-flow

Enable OpenNebula Services
# systemctl enable opennebula opennebula-fireedge opennebula-gate opennebula-flow

Configuring OpenNebula
OpenNebulaâ€™s initial deployment on first usage creates a user oneadmin inside the OpenNebula (not to be confused with system user oneadmin in the Front-end operating system!) based on a randomly generated password read from /var/lib/one/.one/one_auth. To set your own user password from the very beginning, proceed with the following steps before starting the services:

Log in as the oneadmin system user with this command:

sudo -u oneadmin /bin/sh
Create file /var/lib/one/.one/one_auth with initial password in the format oneadmin:<password>

echo 'oneadmin:changeme123' > /var/lib/one/.one/one_auth

Verify Installation
# oneuser show

Now you can try to log in through the Sunstone GUI and Provision GUI. To do so, point your browser to
http://<frontend_address>:2616/fireedge/sunstone

to access to Sunstone and point your browser to
http://<frontend_address>:2616/fireedge/provision 

to access to Provision. 
ou should get to the login page in both cases. The access user is oneadmin and initial (or customized) password is the one from the file /var/lib/one/.one/one_auth on your Front-end.
